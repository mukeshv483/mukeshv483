Welcome to my GitHub repository! As a Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience in backend development, I specialize in building scalable, resilient, and domain-driven systems using Java, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), CQRS, Kafka, Akka, and Hexagonal Architecture. My expertise spans distributed systems, ACID and BASE principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and performance optimization. I am passionate about designing systems that deliver high availability, fault tolerance, and maintainability, leveraging modern tools like Spring Boot, Reactor, Docker, and Kubernetes.
